2>		What are Option Greeks ? 

		The price of an Option depends on certain factors like 
			price 
			volatility of the underlying, 
			time to expiry etc. 

		The Option Greeks are the tools that measure the sensitivity of the option price to the above-mentioned factors. 
		They are often used by professional traders for trading and managing the risk of large positions in options and stocks.These Option Greeks are: 

Delta : is the option Greek that measures the estimated change in option premium/price for a change in the price of the underlying.

		Put option deltas always range from -1 to 0 
			because as the underlying security increases, the value of put options decrease. 
			E.g. - if a put option has a delta of -0.33, if the price of the underlying asset increases by $1, the price of the put option will decrease by $0.33.
		The delta for a call option always ranges from 0 to 1,
			because as the underlying asset increases in price, call options increase in price. 

		Technically, the value of the option's delta is the first derivative of the value of option with respect to the underlying security's Price		


Gamma : measures the estimated change in the Delta of an option for a change in the price of the underlying

Vega : measures the estimated change in the option price for a change in the volatility of the underlying. 

Theta : measures the estimated change in the option price for a change in the time to option expiry. 

Rho : measures the estimated change in the option price for a change in the risk free interest rates. 

Volatility : A measure of stock price fluctuation. Mathematically, volatility is the annualized standard deviation of a stock's daily price changes.

Premium : is the price of an option and is equal to its intrinsic value plus time value. 

Theoretical value : The estimated value of an option derived from a mathematical model.
